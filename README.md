# :wave: WOMEN CONNECT

## 🤓 Project Overview ##
Women Connect is a web application built for networking purposes. It was built during a 2 months apprentice programme where I get to learn more about software enginnering. I built the application from scratch with the guidance of mentors, explored unit testing and built a basic CI/CD pipeline.
